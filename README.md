Github profile README

### Hi there
My name is Blake Schuetz, and I'm a physics undergraduate at ERAU, with an interest in the business applications of quantum technologies, such as quantum computing.

- I'm currently working on assembling and applying Cosmic Watch Detectors, designed by MIT students, in a cosmic ray experiment to enhance the detection of stopping cosmic muons in a mineral oil scintillator. 
- I recently acquired quantum computing certificates through IBM and participated in their Qiskit Global Summer School program in 2025.     
- I'm looking to collaborate on research projects that apply quantum technologies in fundamental physics research.
